PRIORITY:
=========
1. Mouse Real time filtring
2. Control the speed of filtrations
3. Range of Y when filtring
4. Pause and play fix when filtering or remove the button


DONE:
=====
1. Export filters and filtered data
2. Removing single zero or pole
3. Corner case: export filter: error: design is empty
4. Upon "choosing" any filter, its zero and pole
	should be plotted in the z-plane
5. Upon "adding" any filter, its zero and pole
	should be plotted in the z-plane
6. Points slider
7. By default, the user can plot zeros ->
	add a default mode and that means you may want to consider
	converting addPole and addZero to checkable buttons
8. Import filter by drag and drop
9. Corner case: all pass filter exists in library but was moved to the cascaded, didn't check
10. Corner case: showing and hiding the dockwidgets
11. Mouse
12. All pass fine tune ->
	-	Change the z-plane phase response: correct phase on adding and choosing
	-	If the user removed chosen filter,
		it affects the cascaded filter
	-	Set range for z-plane on choosing all pass filter
13. Cleaned Repetition [Perfect]
14. Plotting
15. Import filter by drag and drop
16. Zplane filters examples -> Though you can check why it generates a effectless warning


EXTRA:
======
1. Best practices: dictionaries
3. UI revise colors and whole design
4. 3D visualisation
5. Save application
10. Add conjugate to a single specific zero or pole
11. Fine Tune: addzero and addpole buttons checking
13. Add a quick button to remove all chosen all pass libraries
14. Add a quick button to revert to imported data if mouse was chosen after you imported a data [History].

NOT CONSIDERED WORK:
====================
1. Lengthy data [not necessary]
2. Prepare filters for Discussion [After I made the examples, it is no problem <3]
