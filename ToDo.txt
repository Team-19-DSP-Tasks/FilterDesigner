PRIORITY:
=========
1. Mouse
2. All pass fine tune ->
	-	Toggle to see the cascaded filter phase response [not sure]
	-	Change the z-plane phase response: correct phase on applying or on adding and choosing [not sure]
	-	If the user removed chosen filter,
		its effect on cascading removed
	-	Set range foe z-plane
		
3. Repetition
4. Plotting


DONE:
=====
1. Export filters and filtered data
2. Removing single zero or pole
3. Corner case: export filter: error: design is empty
4. Upon "choosing" any filter, its zero and pole
	should be plotted in the z-plane
5. Upon "adding" any filter, its zero and pole
	should be plotted in the z-plane
6. Points slider
7. By default, the user can plot zeros ->
	add a default mode and that means you may want to consider
	converting addPole and addZero to checkable buttons
8. Import filter by drag and drop
9. Corner case: all pass filter exists in library but was moved to the cascaded, didn't check
10. Corner case: showing and hiding the dockwidgets


EXTRA:
======
1. Best practices: dictionaries
2. Import filter by drag and drop
3. UI revise colors and whole design
4. 3D visualisation
5. Save application
10. Add conjugate to a single specific zero or pole
11. Fine Tune: addzero and addpole buttons checking
12. Zplane filters examples

NOT CONSIDERED WORK:
====================
1. Lengthy data
2. Prepare filters for Discussion
