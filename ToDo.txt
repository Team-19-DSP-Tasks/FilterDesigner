PRIORITY:
=========
1. Mouse
2. All pass fine tune ->
	-	Filters should not be removed from library [postponed]
	-	Upon "choosing" any filter, its zero and pole
		should be plotted in the z-plane
	-	Upon "adding" any filter, its zero and pole
		should be plotted in the z-plane
	-	Plot each filter's phase response [not sure]
	-	Toggle to see the cascaded filter phase response [not sure]
	-	change the z-plane phase response: correct phase on applying or on adding and choosing [not sure]
	-	corner case: if the user removed chosen filter,
		its pole and zero get removed and its effect on cascading removed
		
3. Repetition
4. Points slider/plotting
5. By default, the user can plot zeros ->
	-	add a default mode and that means you may want to consider
		converting addPole and addZero to checkable buttons


DONE:
=====
1. Export filters and filtered data
2. Removing single zero or pole
3. Corner case: export filter: error: design is empty


EXTRA:
======
1. Best practices: dictionaries
2. Import filter by drag and drop
3. UI revise colors and whole design
4. 3D visualisation
5. Save application
6. Corner case: all pass filter exists in library but was moved to the cascaded, didn't check || Change the whole library
8. Corner case: showing and hiding the dockwidgets
9. Import filter by drag and drop
10. Add conjugate to a single specific zero or pole


NOT CONSIDERED WORK:
====================
1. Lengthy data
2. Prepare filters for Discussion
